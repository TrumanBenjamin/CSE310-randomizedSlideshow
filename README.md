{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the JavaScript language.}
For this module I chose to create a random image slideshow that pulls images from a database that I've created. I am building a website for my company and I wanted to build an image slideshow for my home page. After looking at several other websites that use image slideshows on their home page, I decided that I wanted my images to be more dynamic than just the same 3-5 images every time. That was where my idea for this project originated from! 

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
My purpose was to add variety and value to my website. My whole goal with the website I am building is to go a step above what other companies have done with their websites. With that in mind, every element that I've created I've tried to go above and beyond what would be deemed "acceptable." I want to be able to provide the best possible product for my company, and continually redefine what that "best product" can be for me as I continually improve on my skills in this field. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Item 1
One thing that I didn't have the time to complete is styling this element. It looks alright, but I think I'd like it to be a hero element with a text box or logo displayed somewhere inside the slideshow. I have very basic styling on this element right now. 
- Item 2
Another thing I can improve is the way that the 5 bullets display. I've seen some really cool styles on these bullets on several websites, and I will spend some more time styling these to make them look more professional and stand out from the crowd! 
- Item 3
One thing that I can add in the future is adding compression to my images so they load in faster. This is something I will be adding in the near future.
